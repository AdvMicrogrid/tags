Experimental Tagged types C++ library C++14/17. 


# Proposal

This code will eventualy form the basis of several formal proposals to add a overload function, a match function and a tags library to the C++ standard library.


# Development Status

This code is undocumented, untested, constantly changing, and generally not fit for any use whatsoever.


# License

Most of the source code in this project are mine, and those are under the Boost Software License. 

I have adapted the `make_overload` class and the `match` functions from https://github.com/JasonL9000/cppcon14.

# Supported Compilers

The code is known to work on the following compilers:

* GCC 4.9.0 -std=c++1y
